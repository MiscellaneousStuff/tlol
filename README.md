## About

League of Legends Season 11 replay analysis.

## Usage

To use the included notebook, you need to decompress the relevant replay using
7-Zip. Be warned, each replay file is around 1GB because of the inefficient
way the replay files were generated. Then, load up the *.ipynb notebook file
using either Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab or another notebook application
and enter the name of the decompressed file.
